Puppy Time Police
Alpha Prototype
by @DanDoesAThing (Daniel Newby)

===== ===== ===== ===== =====

NOTE

This is a pre-alpha prototype, developed for the inaugural month (June 2020) of the revived One-Game-a-Month Game Jam. Development took place across just over 2 weeks, and forms the basis of a top-down shooter prototype that I intend to later re-use.

I developed this game as a gift for my partner on our anniversary, starring our puppy as a protagonist. This is just the initial game jam release and development will continue into the next month.

KNOWN BUGS

* There is no handling for player defeat/loss. Please exit the executable if you lose.

* There is no win condition currently - nothing will happen on defeating every enemy.

* Game time system is just visual at the moment - nothing will happen on time expiry.

* Shot audio plays simultaneously for every split shot projectile - it can sound crackly.

* Under certain conditions you can glitch into the wall if you aim your blink dash beyond the wall.

CONTROLS

Use WASD to move left, up, down, and right.

GAMEPLAY

There are approximately 13 enemies to defeat in the protoype arena.

Floating weapon collectables near your starting position can be picked up to change your weapon.

Your initial weapon is the BASIC SHOT. It fires a single projectile.

You can also collect the following weapons:

	WIND SCYTHE - two spinning circles that are impossible to aim but are strong, fast, and large.
	SNIPER SHOT - a very slow to aim powerful and fast bullet.
	HEAVY SHOT - a slow travelling fat meteor that deals heavy damage.
	SPLIT SHOT - four fan-spread shots that fire in formation from the player.
	BURST SHOT - three rapid projectiles that fire in series.
	VORTEX SHOT - an orbiting projectile that rotates around the player.
